          <h2>*Introduction to Climate Change*</h2>
          <p>
            You may have heard of 'climate change' quite a lot in recent years.
            You may have been wondering what the fuss over climate change is all
            about and what exactly climate is changing into. Well, Earth's
            climate has changed over billions of years, and this change is
            mainly due to powerful forces from within the Earth and from the
            surroundings around it. Look at the molecule carbon dioxide. It has
            powerful properties of absorbing heat. There isn't a lot of carbon
            dioxide in the atmosphere, so any changes in carbon dioxide have the
            potential to change the atmosphere and the Earth in a big way. Over
            time, some of the carbon contained in carbon dioxide gas is locked
            away in the rocks of the Earth's lithosphere, thanks to what is
            often called the rock cycle. But with massive burns of fossil fuels
            going on during the last few hundred years, more carbon dioxide has
            been released in a few decades compared to what nature takes care of
            through the rock cycle in a few centuries. And with too much carbon
            dioxide staying in the air, Earth now holds onto more heat than it
            allows to go back into space.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            So, carbon dioxide makes Earth a more comfortable place to live. But
            too much of a good thing may not be so good, as the extra heat could
            cause the polar ice to melt, storms to become more violent and shift
            where they occur, and heavy rainfall, droughts, and even forest
            fires to become more common. While the contours of how exactly the
            planet will change due to human activities are still being worked
            out, a number of changes have become apparent. They are all related
            to human activities that are changing the atmosphere, oceans, and
            land surfaces of the Earth. That's why we know climate change is
            real and relevant to humans. While climate has always changed, the
            pace of change has not been this quick in all the periods that life
            has existed on our lovely planet. Indeed, the global mean
            temperature has increased to such an extent in the recent period.
            With the rapidly changing climate, the ability of species to adapt
            to the new environment is stretched while they try to survive and
            maintain life situations on the ever-changing planet.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h2>*Definition and Causes*</h2>
            <p>
              Although climate change and global warming are used interchangeably,
              they are slightly different. Global warming is a part of climate
              change and refers to the increase in temperature close to the
              surface of the Earth. Climate change refers to changes in the
              planet’s average temperature or changes in regional climate
              characteristics over time scales. What are some of the key factors
              behind climate change? Emerging scientific data lends further
              support that the recent surge in global warming is caused by human
              activity. Advances in technology, increased population, and an
              explosion in industrialization have increased the human population’s
              energy demand and have rapidly consumed huge amounts of fuel in our
              ecosystem. Also, human activities in the twentieth century have
              played a main part in increasing Earth’s greenhouse effect. Burning
              fossil fuels for energy introduced large quantities of heat-trapping
              gases into Earth’s atmosphere. These gases prevent heat from leaving
              the atmosphere, which leads to an increase of heat trapped within
              the atmosphere. Over time, this heat rise can affect the planet’s
              weather, ocean currents, and climate.

          <div>
            <h2>*Historical Context*</h2>
            <p>
              Let's fast forward again, this time to the 20th century. Throughout
              the 20th century, carbon dioxide and other gases have been released
              into the atmosphere. The amount of carbon dioxide has increased by
              about 25%, and the concentration of the others has also grown. Part
              of the reason is deforestation to make way for farmland, ranching,
              and development, but most of the additions come from burning coal,
              oil, gasoline, or gas to produce more energy for our homes, cars,
              factories, businesses, and you name it. The atmosphere now contains
              almost 1.5 trillion metric tons of carbon, more than 3.5 trillion
              pounds, far more than any time within the last 20 million years. How
              much is 1.5 trillion metric tons? It's such a huge amount that an
              annual increase of only 6 million metric tons still adds up to a
              substantial fraction of the total each year, producing a big annual
              change in the atmosphere’s carbon dioxide content.

            <h2>*Impact on the Environment*</h2>
            <p>
              One of the greatest impacts of the burning of fossil fuels is on the
              environment. With more carbon in the atmosphere, plants and trees
              can grow faster. They absorb more carbon, but the forests are
              shrinking because of human activities. The roots of trees hold the
              topsoil of Earth, and a lot of fertile soil is washed away with
              water after the trees are cut. Trees also give us the oxygen we
              breathe, slow down the energy of the sun, and keep Earth's
              temperature low. Without trees, the Earth would heat, and
              temperatures could rise even faster. But when we burn them,
              greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere, and the trees are
              gone.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Deforestation must stop soon if high temperatures are to be
              prevented in the future. A big change in the way trees are used for
              paper and construction is needed. Today, too many greenhouse gases
              come from the fact that solid waste is burned in landfills and power
              plants. This has to be done as little as possible if these gases are
              to be transformed into renewable energy or buried underground. Coal
              is the dirtiest fossil fuel because so many impurities are released
              when it is burned. Using oil and natural gas is better. They burn
              more efficiently and have fewer impurities. But still, they also
              need to go. Our sun is a great source of energy. A lot of energy is
              in its light, and this heat is stored in the ground and air. Solar
              energy could be used more. But for the time being, it is a little
              difficult to do, and some big and old equipment will be needed to
              work on a day that looks special. The idea is to convert sunlight
              into electricity.
