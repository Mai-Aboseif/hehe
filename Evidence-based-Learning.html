            <p>
              Hey conventionalist friends,<br> Having a learning system to learn
              about environmental science, or mastering any subject, is crucial
              as it allows you to anticipate the whole trajectory and link it to
              a larger purpose rather than hitting random goals. Especially in
              environmental science, effective learning requires a flexible
              mindset to easily zoom in on the nitty-gritty details and zoom out
              to see the broader picture. My system, particularly, allows you to
              stay motivated, consistent, and organized through:

              <h3>Fantasy realization</h3>
              <p>
                Fantasy realization is a psychological framework developed by
                researcher Gabriele Oettingen that helps people turn dreams into
                achievable outcomes. At its core, it’s about managing the
                tension between dreaming big and reality. Fantasy realization
                involves a deliberate mental process called Mental Contrasting
                that’s functioning based on visualizing success and
                acknowledging obstacles, which is where the system takes place.
                My system provides you with a roadmap that includes both a clear
                destination and strategies for overcoming challenges.

              <h3>Self-Determination Theory</h3>
              <p>
                We've all experienced those moments when we set goals and create
                detailed plans but eventually find ourselves procrastinating.
                Why does this happen? More often than not, this procrastination
                stems from a lack of courage or, in other words, you’re not
                motivated for the task ahead. <br> There are two types of motivation:
                intrinsic and extrinsic. Self-determination theory explains how
                we can leverage intrinsic motivation to create a sustainable
                motivation system. It focuses on three key psychological factors
                that drive effective <work:b></work:b><br><b>
                  1. Autonomy:</b> feeling in control of your behaviors and goals.
                   This sense of being able to take direct action that will result
                    in real change plays a major part in helping people feel self-determined.
                <br><b>2. Competence:</b> – Having the skills or developing the ability to
                 succeed in the task. When people feel that they have the skills needed for success,
                  they are more likely to take actions that will help them achieve their goals.
                <br><b>3. Relatedness:</b> Feeling a sense of connection to others or the broader
                 impact of your work. Dr. Laurie Santos, a Yale professor, explained how
                  appreciating our Common Humanity (common human struggles) can help us overcome
                   the lack of courage and stay consistent with our goals.
                <b></b><br>Thus, Mai Bicycle offers you a workplace that provides you with
                 self-determination theory components.

              <h3>How This Translates to Environmental Science</h3>
              <p>
                Applying this theory to environmental science (or any field)
                means creating a learning system where each milestone feels
                purposeful and connected to the bigger vision. Autonomy ensures
                you’re steering your learning journey; competence keeps you
                improving, and relatedness reminds you why it all
                matters—whether it’s the ecosystems you’re protecting or the
                communities you’re empowering. <br>This shift doesn’t just help you
                stay consistent; it makes the process fulfilling. Because in the
                end, motivation isn’t just about pushing through; it’s about
                finding joy and meaning in the journey itself.
