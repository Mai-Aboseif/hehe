          <h2>Ecosystem</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Introduction to Ecosystems</h2>
          <p>
            One of the reasons the global ecosphere is both amazing and complex
            is that Earth sustains a large number and wide variety of
            ecosystems. An ecosystem is defined as a biological community plus
            all the abiotic factors in the area, meaning all living organisms in
            an area along with their physical and chemical environment.
            Ecosystems can range many orders in size, from microscopic to nearly
            global. Some examples of ecosystems of a particular size might
            include that of a massive redwood tree, a lake in a national park,
            and the tropical rainforest in a basin.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Quantum units of ecosystems are, of course, the millions of
            different species of green plants. Since their green pigments absorb
            the sun's energy, they are called producers, and they are at the
            bottom of the food chain. They are the only type of organism capable
            of using the sun's energy to make energy-rich organic molecules. We
            call these complex, energy-rich molecules the Earth's chemical
            currency. All of the other organisms in the ecosphere, from a tiny
            bacterium to a huge whale, must use producers, as well as other
            organisms, to obtain chemical food. The microbial food chain
            consists of a producer, followed by a primary consumer, a secondary
            consumer, and so on, to the top carnivore. As we go up the food
            chain, the number of individuals in a species decreases.

          <h2>Ecosystem Definition</h2>
          <p>
            Ecosystem science is the study of interrelationships among organisms
            and between those organisms and their physical and social
            environments. There are a number of important words in this
            definition that require exploration to gain a full understanding of
            what ecosystem science is all about. Ecosystems are not the same as
            natural landscapes. For most people, ecosystems are a much broader
            idea than natural landscapes as they combine the natural environment
            with the people and built environments that are part of it.
            Components of all ecosystems can be seen from space and include
            abiotic environments, processes, and organisms.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Ecosystem science seeks to understand how and why the physical and
            social environments of Earth are changing, and the consequences of
            these changes on the economies and quality of life of nations and
            people, the environment, and the capacity of the Earth to support
            humanity. The first thing to notice is that ecosystems are all about
            relationships. One definition of an ecosystem is that it is a
            combination of the organisms within a given geographic area, the
            physical environment in which these organisms live, interact, and
            function, and the relationships among and between these organisms
            and the various aspects of their physical and social environments.

        <div>
          <h2>Types of Ecosystems</h2>
          <p>
            Ecosystems come in many shapes and sizes; they can be just a few
            square meters in area or spread over thousands of square kilometers.
            They can be found on land or in the sea, and they can exist in
            countries on all continents. Ecosystems can be as small as a bush or
            as large as a desert. Some ecosystems are simple, while others are
            very complex. Across the world, ecosystems share several common
            features while also being enormously variable because of differing
            local conditions. Because of this variability, ecosystems are
            studied at a variety of scales, from very large to small scales,
            such as a pond, tree, or even a rock, which are frequently used by
            students and educators who may not have access to the larger study
            sites or which can easily be manipulated in a laboratory.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The basic concept is that all living organisms within an ecosystem
            are dependent on and interact with each other. In the terrestrial
            environment, weather, temperature, and amount of rainfall will
            affect the types of plants that can grow. The types of plants
            present will affect the types of animals that can live in an
            ecosystem. The types of soil will affect the distribution of plants
            by making some plants grow better than others.

          <h2>What do you think?</h2>
          <p>
            - *How do changes in abiotic factors (like temperature and rainfall)
            affect the species composition of an ecosystem? Can you think of
            examples where these changes might lead to a disruption in the food
            chain?*
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            - *How do disturbances in ecosystems (such as deforestation or
            pollution) create cascading effects on other organisms? What
            strategies could help mitigate these impacts?*
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            - *What role do producers (such as plants) play in an ecosystem, and
            what would happen if they were significantly reduced or eliminated
            from an ecosystem? How might this affect the entire food web?*
