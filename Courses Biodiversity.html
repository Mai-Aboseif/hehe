          <h2>Introduction to Biodiversity</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to the course on biodiversity, where we will explore the
            incredible variety of life on Earth, its importance to human
            well-being, and the challenges we face in conserving it.
            Biodiversity, a contraction of "biological diversity," encompasses
            the variety of living organisms, ecosystems, and ecological
            processes that sustain life on our planet. It forms the foundation
            of human development, supports environmental stability, and charges
            economic and cultural health across societies.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Biodiversity Definition</h2>
          <p>
            According to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD),
            biodiversity is the variety of life on Earth. “The variability among
            living organisms from all sources, including, amongst others,
            terrestrial, marine, and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological
            complexes of which they are a part; this includes diversity within
            species, between species, and of ecosystems,” CBD stated.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Biodiversity on Earth results from 3.5 billion years of evolution.
            Although the fascinating biological diversity of our planet, it’s
            exponentially degrading. Our unsustainable practices have caused
            extinctions for over 45,000 years and it’s ever-growing!
            Biodiversity management is one of the most urgent challenges facing
            environmental conservation as we must address the problem soon or
            species extinction will be faster than us.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Why Biodiversity Matters</h2>
          <p>
            Throughout Earth's history, biodiversity has undergone cycles of
            expansion and extinction. However, current extinction rates, driven
            by human activity, are higher than historical background rates.
            Scientists now anticipate “the sixth mass extinction.”
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            When habitats are reduced by 90%, they often lose about half of
            their species. Using real-world examples like the Atlantic Forests
            of Brazil and the Amazon rainforest, we will analyze how
            biodiversity loss affects not just species but entire ecosystems and
            the services they provide to humans, such as clean air, water, and
            fertile soil. This emphasizes the importance of biodiversity not
            only for our Earth’s balance but also for human well-being by
            providing essential ecosystem services such as:
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            - *Provisioning services*: Food, water, timber, and medicine.
            <br />- *Regulating services*: Climate regulation, pollination, and
            disease control. <br />- *Cultural services*: Inspiration,
            recreation, and spiritual enrichment. <br />- *Supporting services*:
            Nutrient cycling and soil formation.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Imagine a world without bees. These tiny pollinators, a small yet
            vital cog in the biodiversity machine, are crucial for growing crops
            that feed billions.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Biodiversity Threats</h2>
          <p>
            As the natural environment erodes, species extinction rates have
            soared to 100–1,000 times the prehistoric background levels, with
            predictions of accelerating losses in the coming decades. While
            larger species like vertebrates and plants are often studied, less
            is known about the extinction rates of invertebrates and microbes,
            which likely dominate biodiversity losses. For instance, Britain’s
            comprehensive Red Data Book shows the invertebrate extinction rates
            of 1–5% per century. When data is scaled globally, it translates
            into the loss of thousands of species annually.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In the following section, we will study how and why these
            extinctions occur.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Extinction</h2>
          <p>
            Extinction is the loss of prominent species like the passenger
            pigeon, dodo, etc. The majority of extinctions likely occur among
            less-studied, species-rich groups such as invertebrates and
            microbes. Since many species don't leave fossils, their extinction
            often goes unnoticed. Without knowing the total number of species,
            it's impossible to determine the absolute number of extinctions
            occurring annually. However, we can make rough estimates about the
            proportion of species lost in a particular area or group based on
            ecological patterns.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            One critical pattern is the species-area relationship, which shows
            that smaller habitats tend to support fewer species. For instance,
            an oceanic island one-tenth the size of another may host roughly
            half the number of species. This relationship applies to isolated
            environments like mountains or lakes and helps predict how habitat
            destruction impacts biodiversity. If a habitat is reduced by 90%,
            such as through deforestation or drainage, it might eventually lose
            half its species. However, questions remain about how habitat
            fragmentation mirrors island isolation and how long it takes for
            species numbers to stabilize (a process called “relaxation”).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Studies of fragmented ecosystems, like the Atlantic Forests of
            Brazil (of which less than 10% remains) initially suggested fewer
            extinctions than predicted. However, researchers such as Brooks and
            Balmford have identified species in these areas as “living dead,”
            species unlikely to survive in the long term. This concept of
            “extinction debt” reflects species already doomed due to habitat
            loss but not yet extinct, meaning biodiversity may continue
            declining over decades.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Using the species-area relationship, we can estimate species loss
            based on habitat reduction. For example, losing 90% of the Amazon
            rainforest could result in the extinction of half its species,
            potentially representing a significant portion of Earth's
            biodiversity. If baseline species richness data is available, we can
            even estimate the number of species likely to be lost within
            specific groups, such as birds or plants. However, predicting the
            timescale for these losses is much harder. Continental fragments may
            have lower extinction rates than islands due to more generalist
            species but could also face higher rates from “edge effects” caused
            by surrounding disturbed habitats.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Natural extinction has always been part of Earth's history, with
            95–99% of all species that ever existed now extinct. The fossil
            record reveals periods of mass extinction, such as the
            Permian-Triassic event, which wiped out 95% of marine species, and
            the Cretaceous event, marking the end of the dinosaurs. Between
            these mass events, background extinction rates suggest an average
            vertebrate species lifetime of 1–2 million years. However, over the
            past century, extinction rates for large vertebrates have
            accelerated drastically, with species lifetimes dropping to 10,000
            years—and potentially as low as 200–400 years in the future. This
            increase represents extinction rates 100–1,000 times higher than the
            prehistoric background level and possibly 10,000 times higher in
            this century. This rapid loss is now recognized as the sixth mass
            extinction, with humanity as a driving force.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Britain, with a rich history of species documentation, offers rare
            insights into invertebrate extinction. Using Red Data Book records,
            the estimated extinction rate for British invertebrates is 1–5% per
            century, aligning with global patterns for other groups. Applying
            this rate to the conservative estimate of 5–15 million species
            suggests that 50,000–750,000 species could be lost per
            century—equivalent to 500–7,500 species annually or 1–20 species per
            day. While thought-provoking, these estimates are uncertain due to
            variations across taxa and ecosystems, as well as the unknown total
            number of species. It’s safer to acknowledge the limits of our
            knowledge and prioritize biodiversity conservation.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Biodiversity embraces various living organisms, the ecosystems they
            are part of, and the ecological processes that interconnect all the
            elements. It is the natural foundation of human development and a
            key component of individuals’ and societies' environmental,
            economic, social, and cultural health. The value of biodiversity, a
            wealth of life and biological resources, is mostly irreplaceable.
            Biodiversity is our conserved biological capital. Over the
            centuries, human use of this capital has increased. At a local level
            and a regional scale, much of our surviving stock of biodiversity
            has been eroded and degraded. The loss has been relatively slow and
            insidious, escaping the notice of many for whom natural diversity
            has become less and less a part of their everyday life experience.
            Today, at the international level, the picture is more obviously one
            of global change that is irreversible. Trends in our key biological
            assets that only very recently were regarded as virginal are now
            consistently alarming and predictable. The habitats that support
            threatened biodiversity have eroded at unprecedented rates. Species
            are becoming extinct through a combination of habitat loss,
            intensification of traditional land use, and pollution. These
            processes are shifting patterns of global biodiversity at all
            scales. The diversity of genes within species is also threatened.
            United efforts at the international, regional, national, and local
            levels are essential to meet the conservation challenges posed by
            the erosion of biodiversity. The income from natural resources that
            is currently fueling development in many countries is provided
            largely by oil, natural gas, coal, and minerals. Predictably, the
            value of the natural resources now underpinning global economies
            will fluctuate according to changing economic and political demands.
            This cannot be so for the stock of the planet's biodiversity.
